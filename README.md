Hi, this is Amulet-Games and I want to use github here to save all my previous projects and future works. <br />

About myself, I am a Unity developer that have been using and learning Unity for 2 to 3 years now. <br />
I like to program major systems like: <br />

Enemy: <br />
- Complex A.I behaviors with BSM <br />
- A.I Disabling System that can be used in wide open level when the player is too far away. <br />

Player: <br />
- TPS Combat and Controls <br />
- Inventory System <br />
- RPG Attributes and Level Up Etc. <br />

There's still alot to learn and experience, I am excitied for any future projects :)
